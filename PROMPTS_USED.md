# Prompts Used During Development

## Initial UX Analysis Prompt

"You are a senior UX auditor. Analyze the structured website content and return strictly formatted JSON with categorized issues and proof grounded in provided content."

---

## Refinement Prompt

"Only reference headings, links, buttons, and paragraphs provided. Do not assume visual layout beyond structured data. Avoid generic UX advice."

---

## JSON Enforcement Prompt

"Return ONLY valid JSON. Do not include explanations outside JSON. Follow this schema exactly: { score, issues, top_improvements }"

---

## Iteration Prompt for Reducing Hallucinations

"Do not invent elements not present in the input. If insufficient data exists, limit findings accordingly."

---

## Score Adjustment Strategy

Score is not generated by LLM.
Score is calculated server-side based on issue count.
